Cerebral Harnessing Education Sidekick for STrategic Engineering Research (Chess Robot for Teaching Computer Aided Engineering)

I originally built this project after teaching enginering design, computer aided deisgn, and computational analysis and realzing that students struggled to see how these skills connect to build a cohesive engineering project. 

After using this in class a few students asked to start doing an indepedent study to look into ways of improving the ssytem. Subsequent updates to this repo will be the result of their work!
